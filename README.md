gerkle
--

gerkle is a merkle tree implementation in go. i'm new to go. i decided to try it as a more reliable substitute for python. python's aggressive typecasting, like if types were as fluid as cranberry sauce at your aunt's thanksgiving dinner, was starting to slowly erode my mental stability. it's like they say: "guys will literally switch to a statically typed language instead of going to therapy."
